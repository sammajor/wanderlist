Sam and I began integrating the third party API and coding out what we would need, as well as creating new tables for the data and images for migrations. Made a keys.py file and put api key in there as well as creating the park.py file which holds the code to us integrating the data. Towards the end we were able to compile data into our database but not all of the data that we needed. We ended up having to take out the "activities" part and going to have to end up creating a new table to hold that information.

Everyone then came together to help and integrate it into the PGADMIN to help with the database. Ended up seeing the data that we had successfully compiled and pushed the branch that Sam and I were working in to gitlab.
