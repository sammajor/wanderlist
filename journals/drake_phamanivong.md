Sam and I began integrating the third party API and coding out what we would need, as well as creating new tables for the data and images for migrations. Made a keys.py file and put api key in there as well as creating the park.py file which holds the code to us integrating the data. Towards the end we were able to compile data into our database but not all of the data that we needed. We ended up having to take out the "activities" part and going to have to end up creating a new table to hold that information.

Everyone then came together to help and integrate it into the PGADMIN to help with the database. Ended up seeing the data that we had successfully compiled and pushed the branch that Sam and I were working in to gitlab.

Today I worked with Sam and we began to finish our API queries as well as our routes. We were then able to get activities into the database, and retrieve the data and seed it into our own database. Then checked the swagger to make sure we were getting 200 responses on our routes.

Today Sam and I worked together to fix some bugs and edit a little bit of the code from last week to include anything that we had missed. Then merged to the main branch and grouped up in with our group to discuss what else we need to work on.

We all switched partners and I worked with Dasia on the Parks List page, getting ideas and seeing if we should use redux.

During the standup the group decided that we should hold off on what we were working on and start on the frontend auth, as well as we should use redux on our project. The groups went back to Sam and I again and we started to tackle the frontend auth.

What we did was handle the login funcion and updating the username and password, being able to login and redirect to a different page.

## 5/24/23 Wednesday, May 24th 2023

I continued working with Sam and what we did today was tackle the parks list page that Dasia and I were orignally doing, since we finished our frontend auth a little bit earlier than expected. We quickly were able to get it to work barebones and populate the page with data, we then went to riley to ask and see how we should add our columns, and he suggested that we use something called Masonry, which we took and used for our project instead of doing columns.

Today was one of the tougher days, Sam and I were working on a new feature for the details page, with it being pagination. Were trying to populate the page with at least 20 parks and have 24 pages for all the 500 parks in the National Parks Database. We got some sort of pages to show but they weren't doing what we wanted them to, so we ended up going to see the SEIRS to see if they can help us out. Ryan was a huge help in putting us into the right direction as we saved some more of the work for tomorrow.

## 5/26/23 Friday, May 26th 2023

Sam and I continued working on the pagination pages were getting somewhere but it also feels like were getting nowhere. Today we also went to see the SEIRS again and they were a huge help in helping us fix some things and trying new things out. Stayed until closing but still couldn't finish what we were trying to do.

## 5/30/23 Tuesday, May 30th 2023

Sam had worked on the paginaiton pages over the weekend(thank you Sam!) so we were able to just move on and switch groups to do some other features. So I worked with Brady and Sandy to create our nav bar, the only issues that we were coming across for the nav bar was it not being able to refresh after logging in or signing out, the only way for it to change was to manually refresh.

## 6/7/23 Wednesday, June 7th 2023

Today Brady, Sandy and I worked on the homepage together. Brady led as he shared his screen, and what we were going for is a moving video/image in the background and as it plays we just have a welcome title as well as a button that takes you straight to the parks list page. As we finished up on that we moved on to start working on the Signup/Signin forms adding images to the back making them cards and centering them so those pages don't look too plain and barebones. We were able to finish up the signup form in time, but the login form was a bit of a challenge due to how it was built differently from the signup form.


## 6/8/23 Thursday, June 8th 2023

Today we split up into different groups today and I got to work with Sandy. We finished up the Signin/Signup forms as well as the Create Trip and Create Trip Note Forms. Making everything kind of the same for consistency and not adding anything crazy just background pictures so it doesn't look too plain.
