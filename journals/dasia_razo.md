Today Sam and I started off the morning with front end details on our park page. I shared screen in the morning and we were placing our entire park detail page on a card to have better control on the elements inside. It took us some time to move our activity list into columns of 3, but we got it done and it looked amazing! After we got that finished Sam shared screen to get our trip history page working, we thought it would be similar to our detail page but it was a little more complex and we had to get some css help from the seirs.


6/6/2023 - Tuesday
Today the team split up to clean up our code. I shared screen with my teammate Sandy and ran flake8 and fixed any errors we had and deleted unused code and imports. Then our group worked as one with merging our branches and we came up with some roadblocks that actually ended up being indentation errors. Once we got back from lunch we all worked together to figure out the CSS for our pages and Sam and I got into a group and worked on the park list page.


6/5/2023 - Monday
Today the team and I split up to fix bugs we noticed over the weekend. Nothing major just little changes with our pagonation and nav bar. Brady shared screen while we debugged together. We were able to fix our bugs to have a completely efficient project working. The group then came together to work as one and came up with a plan to work for the rest of the week.


6/2/2023 - Friday
Today Sam and I worked together on the trip history page as well as our homepage. I shared my screen and he helped me debug. We were facing some minor road blocks with the homepage image but we worked together and got it figured out. After we got done with that we met with the other half of our group and officially finished all of our git issues! 


6/1/2023 - Thursday
Today we switched up groups a little and Brady was working with Drake and I. He led the coding for the day and we had to jump into SIER rooms for some help with an issue we had for a lot of the day. We got that figured out and were able to successfully link our list and single park page by the end of the day. 


5/31/2023 - Wednesday
Today Drake and I continued with the detail page because in our stand up our group decided we wanted to add a create button to the page. I continued sharing the code we worked on yesterday since we were working on the same branch. Drake and I got the page to work and we were completed with our issues and merged for the day. 


5/30/2023 - Tuesday 
Today I led coding with Drake. We worked on the park detail page together and debugged along the way. We did not run into any issues besides some CSS sizing and button issues but we got it done fairly quick so we were able to meet with our entire team again to double check our pages were working correctly. 


5/26/2023 - Friday
Today Brady, Sandy and I worked in a group to do the create trip form. I live coded and shared my screen with them as they helped me debug along the way but then had to switch to Sandy sharing screen because my docker was not working properly. Our swagger and our localhost were retrieving the date order two separate ways and thatâ€™s where we figured our issue is and we looked up documentation to figure out the correct way to register our date.


5/25/2023 - Thursday
Today Brady, Sandy and I started a new branch to resolve our list of trip issue. We had a problem fetching our single trip data and we spent awhile changing our code and console logging to see where our issue was. We realized we had issues with our variable names and were able to fetch our trip data by the end of the day.


5/24/2023 - Wednesday
Today our group was split into two to continue working on our frontend authentication. We continued where we left off last night and were able to get out sign up form and log out form working. We saw on swagger our log out was successful because when we hit execute on the token it came back null, but on localhost:3000 we could not tell if we were logged out. We fixed this by redirecting our page to the login page if our log out with successful. I created the merge request and we were complete with our front end authentication for the project.


5/23/2023 - Tuesday
Today we got into our group and decided to diverge from the react work we started yesterday. As Riley said it would be best to start our authentication for the front end and then continue with the rest of the project. Collectively our group worked on installing redux to the main branch and created our store directory and Store.js file. Once we concluded that we spun the wheel and got into 2 teams, my group is working on the signup and logout front end. We are using redux and we rewatched the lecture from the morning to get a better understanding. 


5/22/2023 - Monday
Today our group continued working on the bug from our notes. We spent the morning finishing our notes to receive them. We realized our notes were on a continuous plus one pattern no matter who was logged in and creating a note. We retrieved the notes via ID. Once we rethought our code we were able to simplify it by not using the account_id or trip_id. After lunch I shared screen so resolve our completed merge request. After that we split up into groups and Drake and I decided to work on the strong end for parks.


5/18/2023 - Thursday
Today during project time I shared my screen with Sandy and Brady who helped me along the way. We were having issues retrieving a single trip so we were running into different errors and codes. Once we could not resolve our error we thought it was best to meet with a SEIR to guide us in the right direction, we realized we had issues with our code with the amount of arguments passed and permissions allowed. Once that issue was solved me continued on to trip notes and once time was up I pushed onto our branch so we can continue on Monday. 


5/17/2023 - Wednesday
Today Brady shared screen while Sandy and I helped debug code . We were working on our forms for the note and trip. We were coming up with a 400 error every time we executed our create trip form, we were looking through the code and realized we had an issue with our endpoint but were able to fix it before the day ended. 


5/16/2023 - Tuesday
Today I shared my screen while working on authentication. We were getting a 401 error for over a half hour so we met with Riley and he helped us with our bug. We were able to get out login and logout to work and by the end of the day our authentication was complete. Once we were finished the group decided it was best to split up into teams and we closed for the day deciding Sandy and I were going to work on the Trip and TripNote section for our API.


5/15/2023 - Monday
Met with the team and we talked out the pros and cons of the different databases we could use. We collectively decided PostgresSQL would be the best fit for our project as well for our future careers since it is highly used. As a group we then set up docker and created the volume to kickstart our project. We started coding our login and logout functions for our authentication, once we felt it was a good stopping point we called it quits for the day and everyone pulled the code to look it over.
