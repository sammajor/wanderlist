Today we got into our group and decided to diverge from the react work we started yesterday. As Riley said it would be best to start our authentication for the front end and then continue with the rest of the project. Collectively our group worked on installing redux to the main branch and created our store directory and Store.js file. Once we concluded that we spun the wheel and got into 2 teams, my group is working on the signup and logout front end. We are using redux and we rewatched the lecture from the morning to get a better understanding.

Today our group continued working on the bug from our notes. We spent the morning finishing our notes to receive them. We realized our notes were on a continuous plus one pattern no matter who was logged in and creating a note. We retrieved the notes via ID. Once we rethought our code we were able to simplify it by not using the account_id or trip_id. After lunch I shared screen so resolve our completed merge request. After that we split up into groups and Drake and I decided to work on the strong end for parks.

Today during project time I shared my screen with Sandy and Brady who helped me along the way. We were having issues retrieving a single trip so we were running into different errors and codes. Once we could not resolve our error we thought it was best to meet with a SEIR to guide us in the right direction, we realized we had issues with our code with the amount of arguments passed and permissions allowed. Once that issue was solved me continued on to trip notes and once time was up I pushed onto our branch so we can continue on Monday.

Today Brady shared screen while Sandy and I helped debug code . We were working on our forms for the note and trip. We were coming up with a 400 error every time we executed our create trip form, we were looking through the code and realized we had an issue with our endpoint but were able to fix it before the day ended.

Today I shared my screen while working on authentication. We were getting a 401 error for over a half hour so we met with Riley and he helped us with our bug. We were able to get out login and logout to work and by the end of the day our authentication was complete. Once we were finished the group decided it was best to split up into teams and we closed for the day deciding Sandy and I were going to work on the Trip and TripNote section for our API.


5/15/2023 - Monday
Met with the team and we talked out the pros and cons of the different databases we could use. We collectively decided PostgresSQL would be the best fit for our project as well for our future careers since it is highly used. As a group we then set up docker and created the volume to kickstart our project. We started coding our login and logout functions for our authentication, once we felt it was a good stopping point we called it quits for the day and everyone pulled the code to look it over.
