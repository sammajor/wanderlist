Today, I worked on:

* Building Postgres database and set-up authentication with entire team

As a team, we decided to build the database together, Brady shared the screen, typing the data. The rest of us were checking if there are any mis-spelling or bugs. We built the Docker container and volume after databse were set-up, and git push to the main branch. Everyone git pull to have the same database.
Later on, I share screen and code with authentication part, login, logout, and creates a user endpoint were successfully showing on localhost, but the user was unable to create due to 401 unauthorized issues.
